## Personal Site

This is a redesign of this project: https://github.com/AdamJackman/Personal-Site

## Motivation

I feel as though the original site that I rushed together no longer represents my front end web design skills,
the upgrade is an attempt to familiarize myself more with css and React.js

## Deploy

Simply run `./freshInstall.sh` to start this up from scratch.
This script is built around Ubuntu.
Main use case is to fully set up a fresh Digital Ocean Droplet
